This is a README File for Assginment - 2# 
After Verifying with you. I have decided to create classes for different questions.However there are few questions which still have separate project names based on the question name. I am truly sorry for the inconvenience. I will try to be more consistent with file and Application Structure. 
Just Run The Program.cs file in the ConsoleApp2 Project which also contains classes for multiple questions.
This time the only two questions which I had created in a different projects are CopyArray and todo list.
I will make sure to be more consistent next time .
